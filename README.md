Internet of Things internship project written in C/C++

NOISE DETECTOR HELPS TO WORK IN HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT
DETECTED NOISE LEVEL APPEARS ONLINE IN THE CLOUD SERVICE

During internship I have got the practical experience wuth ESP32 Microcontroller, WiFi connectivity and MQTT cloud service communication, sensors integration, SPI, UART, PWM, ADC, multimeter and oscilloscope. I have designed PCB board in Eagle CAD, ordered components with BOM.

ESP32-DevKitC is used for Noise Click Project as an entry-level development board. All its GPIO pins are exposed and this allows programming of all necessary functions and connect with sound sensor, LED and buzzer sub-systems.

WITH FREE PROFESSIONAL REAL TIME OPERATING SYSTEM FOR MICROCONTROLLERS
In order to fulfil its goal of noise level monitoring, Noise Detector has to perform several parallel tasks, sending information to the cloud and producing active notifications to coworkers. FreeRTOS (free realtime operating system) allowed to implement this functionality using the Espressif toolchain.
